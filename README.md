# Hotel Reservation System

## Project Overview
This project is a **menu-driven Hotel Reservation System** developed in C++.  
The system is designed to manage hotel bookings, cancellations, room availability,
and reservation records using **file handling (CSV)**.

---

## Main Menu (Partially Implemented – By Both Members)
The **main menu interface** was implemented collaboratively by **both members**.

The menu provides the following options:
1. Add Booking  
2. Cancel Booking  
3. Room System (Available Rooms)  
4. See All Reservations  
5. Exit  

At the current stage, the menu is **partially implemented**, where:
- The **menu structure and navigation logic** are fully working
- **Exit option** works correctly
- **Invalid choice handling** is implemented
- Some menu options display placeholder messages (e.g., "Working...") which are later connected with full functionality

This main menu serves as the **central control system** of the project.
